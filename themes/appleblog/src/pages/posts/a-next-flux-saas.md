## 2. Key Technologies Used

The project utilizes a modern tech stack that includes:

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables SSR and SSG, enhancing performance and user experience.
- **Prisma**: A TypeScript-first ORM that simplifies database interactions and provides type safety.
- **Supabase**: A backend-as-a-service platform that offers a Postgres database, authentication, and real-time capabilities.
- **Clerk Auth**: A user management platform that simplifies authentication and user management.
- **Resend**: A service for sending emails, integrated with React Email for seamless email handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with a focus on responsiveness and customization.

### Example of Integration:
```javascript
import { ClerkProvider, RedirectToSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### Environment Configuration
The project uses a `.env.local` file to manage environment variables, which is crucial for keeping sensitive information secure. The setup process includes copying a template file and updating it with specific configurations.

- **useLocalStorage**: A utility for persisting data in the browser's local storage, which can be useful for maintaining user preferences.

### Example of a Custom Hook:
```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(storedValue));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  }, [key, storedValue]);

  return [storedValue, setStoredValue];
}
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome
