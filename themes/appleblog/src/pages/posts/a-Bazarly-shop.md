## Under the Hood

# Technical Deep-Dive: Bazarly E-Commerce Platform

## 1. Architecture Decisions

The architecture of Bazarly is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy maintenance and future enhancements. The platform follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend and backend are separated, enabling independent development and deployment.

### Microservices Approach
- **Frontend**: Built using React.js, the frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
- **Backend**: The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, serving as the API layer that handles business logic, data processing, and database interactions.

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database is used to store user data, product information, orders, and vendor details. The choice of PostgreSQL allows for complex queries and data integrity.
- **ORM**: Prisma ORM is utilized to interact with the database, providing a type-safe and intuitive API for database operations.

### Security Considerations
- **JWT for Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication, ensuring secure access to protected routes. This allows for stateless authentication, which is scalable and efficient.

## 2. Key Technologies Used

### Frontend Technologies
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing, enhancing code quality and reducing runtime errors.
- **React.js**: A popular library for building user interfaces, enabling the creation of reusable components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Manages application state efficiently, allowing for predictable state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with a focus on responsiveness.

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Prisma ORM**: Simplifies database access and provides type safety.
- **Cloudinary**: Used for image storage and management, allowing for easy image uploads and transformations.
- **Aamarpay**: A payment gateway integrated for processing transactions.

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### Advanced Filtering
The product filtering feature allows users to filter products based on various attributes. This is implemented using a combination of query parameters and state management in Redux. For example, the filtering logic might look like this:

```javascript
const filterProducts = (products, filters) => {
  return products.filter(product => {
    return (
      (filters.category ? product.category === filters.category : true) &&
      (filters.priceRange ? product.price >= filters.priceRange[0] && product.price <= filters.priceRange[1] : true)
    );
  });
};
```

### Vendor Following
The ability for customers to follow vendors is implemented using a many-to-many relationship in the database. Each user can follow multiple vendors, and each vendor can have multiple followers. This is managed through a join table in PostgreSQL.

### Flash Sales
Flash sales are implemented using a time-based logic that checks the current time against the sale start and end times. This is done in the backend, where a scheduled job can be set up to activate or deactivate sales automatically.
