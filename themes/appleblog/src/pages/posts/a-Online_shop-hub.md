## Under the Hood

# Technical Deep-Dive: Online Shop Project

## 1. Architecture Decisions

The architecture of the Online Shop project is designed to be modular and scalable, leveraging modern web development practices. The key architectural decisions include:

- **Component-Based Structure**: The application is built using React, which promotes a component-based architecture. Each UI element is encapsulated within its own component, making it reusable and easier to manage. For example, the product listing, cart, and navigation are all separate components.

- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit is used for state management, allowing for a centralized store that can be accessed by any component. This is particularly useful for managing the cart state and user preferences across the application.

- **Routing**: React Router DOM is utilized for client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between different views (e.g., product categories, individual product pages, and the cart). This enhances the user experience by preventing full page reloads.

- **Data Fetching**: React Query is employed to manage server state and data fetching. It simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and synchronizing server data with the UI, which is crucial for an e-commerce application that relies on dynamic product data.

## 2. Key Technologies Used

The Online Shop project incorporates several key technologies that enhance its functionality and performance:

- **React**: The core library for building the user interface, allowing for the creation of interactive and dynamic web applications.

- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing, which helps catch errors during development and improves code quality. For instance, defining interfaces for product data ensures that the application handles data consistently.

- **Vite**: A build tool that offers fast development and hot module replacement, significantly improving the development experience.

- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling of components without leaving the HTML. This approach promotes consistency and reduces the need for custom CSS.

- **React Query**: Manages server state and caching, making data fetching more efficient. It automatically handles caching and background updates, which is essential for keeping product data fresh.

- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplifies state management by providing a set of tools and best practices for managing application state.

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

Several interesting implementation details contribute to the functionality and user experience of the Online Shop:

- **Session Storage**: The application uses `SessionStorage` to temporarily store user data (e.g., cart items) during the active browser session. This ensures that users do not lose their cart items when navigating between pages. For example:
  ```javascript
  sessionStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cartItems));
  ```

- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, utilizing TailwindCSS's utility classes to adapt the layout for different screen sizes. Media queries are automatically handled by Tailwind, allowing for a seamless experience on mobile devices.

- **Unit Testing**: The project includes unit tests using React Testing Library and Jest, ensuring that components behave as expected. For example, testing a product component might look like this:
  ```javascript
  test('renders product name', () => {
    render(<Product name="Test Product" />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/Test Product/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  ```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

Throughout the development of the Online Shop project, several technical challenges were encountered and successfully addressed:

- **State Synchronization**: One challenge was ensuring that the cart state remained synchronized across different components. This was resolved by using Redux Toolkit to manage the cart state globally, allowing any component to access and update the cart.
