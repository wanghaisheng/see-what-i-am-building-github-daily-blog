### Project Structure

The project structure is designed for clarity and ease of use:

```text
├── public/
├── messages/
│       └── en.json
│       └── {locale1}.json
│
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro (redirects to pages/en/)
│   └── pages/en/
│       └── index.astro
│   └── pages/{locale1}/
│       └── index.astro
│
└── package.json
```

- **Localization Files**: The `messages/` directory contains JSON files for each locale, allowing for easy management of translations. For example, `messages/en.json` might look like this:

```json
{
  "welcome": "Welcome to our website!",
  "description": "This is a multilingual site."
}
```

- **Dynamic Routing**: The project supports dynamic routing based on language, allowing for clean URLs. For instance, the structure allows for both `src/pages/en/index.astro` and `src/pages/es/index.astro`.

1. Update `languageTags` in `./project.inlang/settings.json`.
2. Update `i18n.locales` in `./astro.config.mjs`:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  i18n: {
    defaultLocale: "en",
    locales: ["en", {_new_locale_}],
  }
})
```

3. Create a new translation file in `./messages/{locale}.json`.

This structured approach minimizes the risk of errors and ensures that developers can easily extend the site to support additional languages.

### Content Management

The template allows for the organization of content by language, which can be a challenge in multilingual projects. By using a content collection structure, developers can manage blog posts or other content types efficiently:

```text
