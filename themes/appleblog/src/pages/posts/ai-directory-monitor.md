## Lessons from the Trenches

To combine the two URL lists and monitor their sitemaps for new URLs, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Combine the URL Lists

Assuming you have two lists of URLs, one from the `.ai` scrape and another from the domain with 'ai' in the title, you can combine them into a single list. Hereâ€™s a simple example in Python:

```python
# Sample URL lists
ai_urls = [
    "https://example1.ai",
    "https://example2.ai",
    # Add more URLs from your .ai scrape
]

domain_ai_urls = [
    "https://example3.com/ai",
    "https://example4.com/ai",
    # Add more URLs from your domain scrape
]

# Combine the lists
combined_urls = list(set(ai_urls + domain_ai_urls))

# Print combined URLs
for url in combined_urls:
    print(url)
```

### Step 2: Monitor Sitemaps for New URLs

To monitor the sitemaps of the combined URLs, you can use a library like `requests` to fetch the sitemap and `xml.etree.ElementTree` to parse it. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```python
import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def fetch_sitemap(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url + "/sitemap.xml")
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad responses
        return response.text
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching sitemap for {url}: {e}")
        return None

def parse_sitemap(sitemap_content):
    urls = []
    root = ET.fromstring(sitemap_content)
    for child in root.findall('{http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1}url'):
        loc = child.find('{http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1}loc').text
        urls.append(loc)
    return urls

# Monitor each combined URL
for url in combined_urls:
    sitemap_content = fetch_sitemap(url)
    if sitemap_content:
        new_urls = parse_sitemap(sitemap_content)
        # Here you can add logic to check for new URLs and add them to your site
        print(f"New URLs found in {url}: {new_urls}")
```

### Step 3: Key Technical Lessons Learned

1. **Error Handling**: Always implement error handling when making network requests to avoid crashes due to network issues.
2. **Data Structures**: Use sets to avoid duplicate URLs when combining lists.
3. **XML Parsing**: Familiarize yourself with XML parsing libraries to handle sitemap data effectively.

### Step 4: What Worked Well

- The combination of URL lists was straightforward using Python's list and set functionalities.
- Fetching and parsing sitemaps using requests and ElementTree was efficient for extracting URLs.

### Step 5: What You'd Do Differently

- Implement a more robust monitoring system that checks for changes in sitemaps at regular intervals (e.g., using a cron job).
- Consider using a database to store previously found URLs to easily check for new additions.

### Step 6: Advice for Others

- Start with a clear plan for how you will combine and monitor URLs.
- Test your code with a small set of URLs before scaling up to ensure it works as expected.
- Keep your code modular to make it easier to maintain and update in the future.

By following these steps, you can effectively combine your URL lists and monitor them for new additions.
