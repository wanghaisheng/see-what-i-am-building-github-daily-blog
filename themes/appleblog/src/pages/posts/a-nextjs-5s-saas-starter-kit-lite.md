## Under the Hood

# Technical Deep-Dive: Makerkit - Next.js Supabase SaaS Starter Kit (Lite)

## 1. Architecture Decisions

The Makerkit SaaS Starter Kit adopts a **monorepo architecture** to streamline the development process and enhance code organization. This approach allows for better management of shared components and features across multiple applications within the same repository. The project structure is divided into two main directories:

- **apps/**: Contains the main applications, including the Next.js application.
- **packages/**: Houses shared libraries and features, promoting code reuse and modularity.

### Project Structure

```
apps/
├── web/                  # Next.js application
│   ├── app/             # App Router pages
│   │   ├── (marketing)/ # Public marketing pages
│   │   ├── auth/        # Authentication pages
│   │   └── home/        # Protected app pages
│   ├── supabase/        # Database & migrations
│   └── config/          # App configuration
│
packages/
├── ui/                  # Shared UI components
└── features/           # Core feature packages
    ├── auth/           # Authentication logic
    └── ...
```

This structure allows developers to easily navigate the codebase, understand the relationships between components, and maintain a clean separation of concerns.

## 2. Key Technologies Used

The Makerkit Starter Kit leverages a modern tech stack that includes:

- **Next.js 15**: A React-based framework that supports server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and SEO.
- **Supabase**: A real-time database that provides authentication and storage solutions, simplifying backend development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with a focus on customization.
- **Turborepo**: A tool for managing monorepos, enabling efficient builds and dependency management.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code quality and maintainability.

### Example of TypeScript Usage

The kit is fully configured with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier, ensuring a consistent coding style and reducing runtime errors. For instance, a simple user authentication function might look like this:

```typescript
import { supabase } from '../supabaseClient';

export const signIn = async (email: string, password: string): Promise<void> => {
  const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({ email, password });
  if (error) throw new Error(error.message);
  console.log('User signed in:', user);
};
```

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### User Authentication Flow

The authentication flow is managed through Supabase, which simplifies the process of user management. The authentication pages are located in the `apps/web/app/auth` directory, while the logic is encapsulated in the `@kit/auth` package. This separation allows for easy reuse of authentication logic across different applications.

### Internationalization (i18n)

The kit includes built-in support for internationalization using the `i18next` library. This feature allows developers to easily manage translations for different languages, enhancing the accessibility of the SaaS application. The i18n setup is integrated into both the client and server, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

### Responsive Design

Using Tailwind CSS, the kit provides a responsive design out of the box. The marketing pages, located in `apps/web/app/(marketing)`, are designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Managing State with React Query

One of the challenges in building a SaaS application is managing data fetching and caching efficiently. The kit utilizes **React Query** to handle server state management, which simplifies data fetching and synchronization with the server. This library provides hooks for fetching, caching, and updating data, reducing the need for boilerplate code.

### Example of Data Fetching with React Query

Here’s an example of how to fetch user data using React Query:

```typescript
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import { supabase } from '../supabaseClient';

export const useUserData = (userId: string) => {
  return useQuery(['user', userId], async () => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('users')
      .select('*')
      .eq('id', userId);
    if (error) throw new Error(error.message);
    return data;
  });
};
```

### Handling Migrations with Supabase

Managing database migrations can be complex, especially in a collaborative environment. The kit provides a streamlined process for creating and applying migrations using the Supabase CLI. Developers can create new migrations with a simple command:

```bash
pnpm --filter web supabase migration new --name <migration-name>
```

This command generates a new migration file, allowing
