## Project Genesis

As a lifelong Marvel fan, I’ve always found myself swept up in the excitement of new films and series, eagerly anticipating each release. But with the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the constant reshuffling of release dates, keeping track of everything has become a Herculean task. I often found myself scrolling through endless lists and timelines, trying to piece together the chronological order of events, only to be left more confused than before. That’s when the spark of inspiration hit me: what if I could create an open-source, interactive timeline that not only organizes all the Marvel films and series chronologically but also updates in real-time as new information becomes available?

My personal motivation for this project stems from my own struggles to keep up with the MCU. I wanted a tool that would allow fans like me to easily navigate the intricate web of stories, characters, and timelines without the frustration of outdated information. I envisioned a platform where anyone could access the latest release dates and see how everything fits together, all in one place.

Of course, the journey to bring this idea to life wasn’t without its challenges. I faced hurdles in gathering accurate data, ensuring the timeline was user-friendly, and figuring out how to make it interactive. But with each obstacle, my determination only grew stronger. I spent countless hours researching, coding, and refining the design, fueled by the excitement of what this project could mean for fellow Marvel enthusiasts.

The result? A comprehensive, interactive Marvel Order Astro Timeline that not only organizes the films and series chronologically but also allows users to see the latest updates at a glance. Whether you’re a die-hard fan or just dipping your toes into the MCU, this tool is designed to enhance your viewing experience and keep you in the loop. Join me as we dive into the world of Marvel like never before!
