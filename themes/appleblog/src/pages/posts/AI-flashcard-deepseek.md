- **Deepseek API**: An external API that provides AI services for generating flashcards based on user-defined topics.

### Example of Next.js Usage:
The application structure follows the Next.js conventions, with pages organized in the `pages` directory. For instance, the main page might look like this:

```javascript
// pages/index.js
import Head from 'next/head';
import FlashcardManager from '../components/FlashcardManager';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>AI闪卡学习助手</title>
      </Head>
      <FlashcardManager />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### AI-Assisted Flashcard Generation
The application allows users to input a topic or custom content, which is then sent to the Deepseek API for flashcard generation. This interaction is handled asynchronously to ensure a smooth user experience.

```javascript
// utils/api.js
export const generateFlashcards = async (topic) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.deepseek.com/generate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.DEEPSKEE_API_KEY}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ topic }),
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

### Card Management
Users can manage their flashcards through a simple interface that allows them to import, view, and navigate through cards using keyboard shortcuts. This enhances usability, especially for users who prefer keyboard navigation.

```javascript
// components/FlashcardManager.js
const FlashcardManager = () => {
  const [cards, setCards] = useState([]);

  const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowRight') {
      // Logic to show next card
    } else if (event.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
      // Logic to show previous card
    } else if (event.key === ' ') {
      // Logic to toggle card visibility
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    };
  }, [cards]);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render flashcards */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### API Integration
One of the significant challenges was integrating the Deepseek API effectively. Handling API responses and ensuring that the application remains responsive while waiting for data was crucial. This was addressed by implementing asynchronous functions and managing loading states.
