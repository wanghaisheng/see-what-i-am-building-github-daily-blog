  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
        colors: {
          primary: '#1DA1F2',
        },
      },
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: [],
  };
  ```

- **Sitemap Generation**: The boilerplate includes a script to automatically generate a sitemap based on the project's routes. This is crucial for SEO and can be implemented as follows:
