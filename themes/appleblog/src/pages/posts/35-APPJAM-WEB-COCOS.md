The application follows a component-based architecture, leveraging React for building reusable UI components. This approach enhances maintainability and scalability, allowing developers to work on individual components without affecting the entire application.

### Key Architectural Choices:
- **Component-Based Structure**: Each feature of the application is encapsulated within its own component, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
- **State Management**: Zustand is used for state management, providing a simple and flexible way to manage application state without the boilerplate often associated with Redux.
- **API Layer**: The application has a dedicated API layer to handle data fetching and caching, ensuring efficient communication with the backend services.

## 2. Key Technologies Used

The COCOS project utilizes a modern tech stack that includes:

- **React**: For building user interfaces with a component-based architecture.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances code quality and maintainability by providing static typing.
- **Zustand**: A minimalistic state management library that allows for easy state management without complex setups.
- **Tanstack Query (React Query)**: For data fetching and caching, simplifying server state management.
- **Vercel**: For deployment, providing a seamless way to host and serve the application globally.

### Example of State Management with Zustand:
```javascript
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  pets: [],
  addPet: (pet) => set((state) => ({ pets: [...state.pets, pet] })),
  removePet: (petId) => set((state) => ({ pets: state.pets.filter(pet => pet.id !== petId) })),
}));
```

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### Component Structure
The application is organized into a clear folder structure, which aids in navigation and understanding of the codebase. Each feature has its own directory, containing components, hooks, and utilities.

### Example of a Component:
```javascript
import React from 'react';

const PetCard = ({ pet }) => {
  return (
    <div className="pet-card">
      <img src={pet.image} alt={pet.name} />
      <h3>{pet.name}</h3>
      <p>{pet.symptoms.join(', ')}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PetCard;
```

### Styling with Vanilla Extract
The project uses Vanilla Extract for styling, which allows for type-safe and modular CSS. This approach helps maintain a consistent design system across the application.

### Example of a Styled Component:
```javascript
import { style } from '@vanilla-extract/css';

export const petCardStyle = style({
  border: '1px solid #ccc',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  padding: '16px',
  textAlign: 'center',
});
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Challenge: State Management Complexity
Initially, the team faced challenges with managing the application state, especially as the number of components grew. The introduction of Zustand simplified state management, allowing for a more intuitive approach to handling global state.

### Challenge: API Integration
Integrating with external APIs for fetching pet-related data posed challenges in terms of error handling and data synchronization. By using Tanstack Query, the team was able to streamline data fetching, implement caching strategies, and handle loading states effectively.

### Example of Data Fetching with Tanstack Query:
```javascript
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

const useFetchPets = () => {
  return useQuery('pets', async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/pets');
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    return response.json();
  });
};
```

### Challenge: Deployment and CI/CD
Setting up a smooth deployment process was initially cumbersome. By utilizing Vercel, the team was able to automate deployments and integrate continuous deployment practices, ensuring that the latest changes are always live.
