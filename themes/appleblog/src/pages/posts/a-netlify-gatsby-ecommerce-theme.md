## Under the Hood

# Technical Deep-Dive: Gatsby E-commerce Theme by Matter

## 1. Architecture Decisions

The architecture of the Gatsby E-commerce theme is designed to provide a flexible and scalable foundation for building e-commerce websites. The key architectural decisions include:

- **Component-Based Structure**: The theme follows a component-based architecture, leveraging React's capabilities. This allows for reusable UI components, such as the `<Hero/>` component, which can be easily customized and extended. For example, the `<Hero/>` component is defined as follows:

  ```jsx
  <Hero
    maxWidth='500px'
    image={'/banner1.png'}
    title={'Essentials for a cold winter'}
    subtitle={'Discover Autumn Winter 2021'}
    ctaText={'shop now'}
    ctaAction={goToShop}
  />
  ```

- **File-Based Routing**: The theme utilizes Gatsby's file-based routing system, where each `.js` file in the `src/pages/` directory corresponds to a route in the application. This simplifies navigation and makes it easy to add new pages.

- **Configuration-Driven Content**: The use of a `src/config.json` file for managing header and footer links allows for easy updates and customization without modifying the codebase. This approach enhances maintainability and flexibility.
