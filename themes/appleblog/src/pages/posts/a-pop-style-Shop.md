## Project Genesis

# ðŸŒŸ PopShop ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the vibrant world of PopShop! As I sit down to share the journey behind this exciting eCommerce platform, I canâ€™t help but reflect on the spark that ignited this project. It all began with a simple idea: to create a space where creativity and collaboration could thrive. I envisioned a community where developers, designers, and passionate individuals could come together to share their ideas and innovations, and thus, PopShop was born.

My personal motivation for diving into this project stemmed from my own experiences in the tech world. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity, and I wanted to build something that not only showcased beautiful products but also encouraged collaboration among like-minded individuals. The thought of fostering a community where ideas could flourish was incredibly inspiring, and I knew I had to bring this vision to life.

Of course, the journey wasnâ€™t without its challenges. As I embarked on this adventure, I faced numerous hurdlesâ€”from selecting the right tech stack to ensuring a seamless user experience. Navigating the complexities of React TypeScript and integrating Supabase for the backend and database was no small feat. There were moments of doubt and frustration, but each challenge only fueled my determination to create something truly special.

In overcoming these obstacles, I discovered innovative solutions that not only enhanced the functionality of PopShop but also enriched the overall user experience. By leveraging the power of Daisy UI, I was able to design a visually appealing interface that invites users to explore and engage with the platform. The result is a dynamic eCommerce website that embodies the spirit of collaboration and creativity.

Join me as we delve deeper into the world of PopShop, where every click opens the door to new ideas and possibilities. Together, letâ€™s celebrate the beauty of creativity and the power of community!

## From Idea to Implementation



## Under the Hood

# Technical Deep-Dive: PopShop eCommerce Website

## 1. Architecture Decisions

The architecture of PopShop is designed to be modular and scalable, leveraging a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The key architectural decisions include:

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript was chosen for the frontend to provide a robust and type-safe development experience. This allows for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.
  
- **Styling**: Daisy UI, a component library built on Tailwind CSS, was selected for its utility-first approach, enabling rapid UI development while maintaining a consistent design language.

- **Backend and Database**: Supabase serves as the backend and database solution. It provides a real-time database, authentication, and storage, which simplifies the development process by offering a complete backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solution.

- **Deployment**: The application is deployed using Vercel, which offers seamless integration with GitHub for continuous deployment, ensuring that the latest changes are automatically reflected in the production environment.

### Example Architecture Diagram

```
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   React Frontend  | <--> |   Supabase Backend |
| (TypeScript, Daisy UI) |   | (Auth, Database)  |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|   Vercel Hosting   |
+-------------------+
```

## 2. Key Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components.
  
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code quality and developer experience.

- **Daisy UI**: A component library that extends Tailwind CSS, providing pre-designed components that can be easily customized.

- **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative that provides a real-time database, authentication, and storage solutions.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with a focus on responsiveness and customization.

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple React component using TypeScript and Daisy UI:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick }) => {
  return (
    <button
      className="btn btn-primary"
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

- **User Authentication**: Supabase provides built-in authentication features, allowing users to sign up and log in easily. The integration is straightforward, using Supabase's client library to handle authentication flows.

- **Real-time Features**: Leveraging Supabase's real-time capabilities, the application can update the UI in response to database changes without requiring a page refresh. This enhances the user experience, especially in a shopping context where inventory levels may change frequently.

- **Responsive Design**: The use of Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI ensures that the application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices. The utility classes allow for quick adjustments to layout and styling.

### Example of Real-time Data Fetching

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { supabase } from './supabaseClient';

const ProductsList = () => {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchProducts = async () => {
      const { data } = await supabase.from('products').select('*');
      setProducts(data);
    };

    fetchProducts();

    const subscription = supabase
      .from('products')
      .on('INSERT', (payload) => {
        setProducts((prev) => [...prev, payload.new]);
      })
      .subscribe();

    return () => {
      supabase.removeSubscription(subscription);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {products.map((product) => (
        <div key={product.id}>{product.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

- **State Management**: Managing the state across various components was initially challenging. The team decided to use React's Context API to provide a global state for user authentication and cart management, simplifying data flow and reducing prop drilling.

- **Deployment Issues**: During the initial deployment phase, there were issues with environment variables not being set correctly in Vercel. The team resolved this by ensuring that all necessary environment variables were configured in the Vercel dashboard.

- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: When integrating Supabase, CORS issues arose when making API calls from the frontend. This was resolved by configuring the Supabase project settings to allow requests from the frontend domain.
