## Under the Hood

# Technical Deep-Dive: E-Commerce Application

## 1. Architecture Decisions

The architecture of the E-Commerce Application is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable. The application follows a microservices architecture, separating the backend, frontend, and dashboard into distinct repositories. This separation allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each component.

### Key Architectural Choices:

- **Microservices**: The application is divided into three main services: Backend, Frontend, and Dashboard. This allows for independent scaling and deployment.
- **RESTful API**: The backend exposes a RESTful API for communication with the frontend and dashboard, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and enabling easy integration with third-party services.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication and authorization, allowing users to maintain sessions without server-side state management.

## 2. Key Technologies Used

The E-Commerce Application leverages a modern technology stack to ensure high performance and a seamless user experience. Below are the key technologies used:

### Frontend:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the creation of reusable UI components.
- **Redux**: For state management, allowing for a predictable state container that helps manage the application state across components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with a focus on responsiveness and customization.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a fast development environment and optimized production builds.

### Backend:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications, allowing the use of JavaScript on the server side.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the creation of RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user, product, and transaction data, providing flexibility in data modeling.

### Other Technologies:

- **Stripe/Aamarpay**: For payment processing, integrating secure payment gateways to handle transactions.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, used for form validation and ensuring data integrity.

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### State Management with Redux

The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management, which simplifies the process of managing global state. The following code snippet demonstrates how to set up a slice for managing the cart state:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart',
  initialState: {
    items: [],
    totalAmount: 0,
  },
  reducers: {
    addItem(state, action) {
      const newItem = action.payload;
      state.items.push(newItem);
      state.totalAmount += newItem.price;
    },
    removeItem(state, action) {
      const id = action.payload;
      const existingItem = state.items.find(item => item.id === id);
      if (existingItem) {
        state.items = state.items.filter(item => item.id !== id);
        state.totalAmount -= existingItem.price;
      }
    },
  },
});

export const { addItem, removeItem } = cartSlice.actions;
export default cartSlice.reducer;
```

### Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS

The application employs Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for rapid development of responsive layouts. For example, the following code snippet demonstrates how to create a responsive card component for displaying products:

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg m-4">
  <img class="w-full" src="product-image.jpg" alt="Product Image">
  <div class="px-6 py-4">
    <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Product Name</div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">Product description goes here.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="px-6 pt-4 pb-2">
    <span class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2 mb-2">Category</span>
    <span class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700">Price: $XX.XX</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Handling Cart Functionality

One of the significant challenges was implementing the cart functionality, particularly the restriction of adding products from multiple vendors. The solution involved maintaining a single vendor context in the cart state. If a user attempts to add a product from a different vendor, a warning is displayed:

```javascript
if (currentVendor !== newProduct.vendor) {
  alert('You can only add products from one vendor at a time.');
}
```

### Authentication and Authorization

Implementing secure authentication using JWT posed challenges, particularly in managing token expiration and refresh. The application uses a middleware to check the validity of the JWT on protected routes
