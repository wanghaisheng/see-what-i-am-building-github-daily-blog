## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### Real-time Performance Tracking

One of the standout features of Luro is its real-time performance tracking across various social media platforms. This is implemented using WebSocket connections that allow the application to receive updates without needing to refresh the page. For example:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://api.socialmedia.com/track');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    updatePerformanceMetrics(data);
};
```

### Custom Report Generation

Luro allows users to generate custom reports based on their social media performance. This feature utilizes a combination of user-selected metrics and a reporting engine that formats the data into a user-friendly layout. The report generation logic can be encapsulated in a service:

```typescript
class ReportService {
    generateReport(metrics: Metric[], format: string): Report {
        // Logic to format metrics into a report
    }
}
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Handling Asynchronous Data

One of the significant challenges faced during development was managing asynchronous data fetching from multiple APIs. To address this, Luro employs React Query, which simplifies data fetching and caching. This allows the application to handle loading states and errors gracefully:

```javascript
const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery('socialMediaData', fetchSocialMediaData);

if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
if (error) return <ErrorMessage message={error.message} />;
```

### Ensuring Security with Authentication

Implementing secure authentication was another challenge. By using Clerk, Luro benefits from a robust authentication system that includes features like multi-factor authentication and session management. The integration is straightforward, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than security concerns.

```javascript
import { ClerkProvider, RedirectToSignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

function App() {
    return (
        <ClerkProvider>
            <RedirectToSignIn />
            {/* Other components */}
        </ClerkProvider>
    );
}
```

### Performance Optimization

To ensure optimal performance, especially with real-time data updates, Luro implements code-splitting and lazy loading for components. This reduces the initial load time and improves the overall user experience:

```javascript
const LazyLoadedComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyLoadedComponent'));

function App() {
    return (
        <React.Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
            <LazyLoadedComponent />
        </React.Suspense>
    );
}
```
